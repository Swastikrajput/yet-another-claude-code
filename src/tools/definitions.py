# Planning Tools
# =============================================================================

WRITE_TODOS_TOOL = {
    "name": "write_todos",
    "description": """Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current work session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.

Only use this tool if you think it will be helpful in staying organized. If the user's request is trivial and takes less than 3 steps, it is better to NOT use this tool and just do the task directly.

## When to Use This Tool
Use this tool in these scenarios:

1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions
2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations
3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list
4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)
5. The plan may need future revisions or updates based on results from the first few steps

## How to Use This Tool
1. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work.
2. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation.
3. You can also update future tasks, such as deleting them if they are no longer necessary, or adding new tasks that are necessary. Don't change previously completed tasks.
4. You can make several updates to the todo list at once. For example, when you complete a task, you can mark the next task you need to start as in_progress.

## When NOT to Use This Tool
It is important to skip using this tool when:
1. There is only a single, straightforward task
2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no benefit
3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps
4. The task is purely conversational or informational

## Task States and Management

1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:
   - pending: Task not yet started
   - in_progress: Currently working on (you can have multiple tasks in_progress at a time if they are not related to each other and can be run in parallel)
   - completed: Task finished successfully

2. **Task Management**:
   - Update task status in real-time as you work
   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)
   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones
   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely
   - IMPORTANT: When you write this todo list, you should mark your first task (or tasks) as in_progress immediately!.
   - IMPORTANT: Unless all tasks are completed, you should always have at least one task in_progress to show the user that you are working on something.

3. **Task Completion Requirements**:
   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it
   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress
   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved
   - Never mark a task as completed if:
     - There are unresolved issues or errors
     - Work is partial or incomplete
     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion
     - You couldn't find necessary resources or dependencies
     - Quality standards haven't been met

4. **Task Breakdown**:
   - Create specific, actionable items
   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps
   - Use clear, descriptive task names

Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.
Remember: If you only need to make a few tool calls to complete a task, and it is clear what you need to do, it is better to just do the task directly and NOT call this tool at all.""",

Usage:
- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path
- By default, it reads up to 500 lines starting from the beginning of the file
- **IMPORTANT for large files and codebase exploration**: Use pagination with offset and limit parameters to avoid context overflow
  - First scan: read_file(path, limit=100) to see file structure
  - Read more sections: read_file(path, offset=100, limit=200) for next 200 lines
  - Only omit limit (read full file) when necessary for editing
- Specify offset and limit: read_file(path, offset=0, limit=100) reads first 100 lines
- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated
- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful.
- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.
- You should ALWAYS make sure a file has been read before editing it.""",

# Sub-Agent / Task Delegation Tools

TASK_TOOL = {

    "description": """Launch an ephemeral subagent to handle complex, multi-step independent tasks with isolated context windows.

Available agent types and the tools they have access to:
- general-purpose: General-purpose agent for researching complex questions, searching for files and content, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries use this agent to perform the search for you. This agent has access to all tools as the main agent.

When using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.

## Usage notes:
1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses
2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.
3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.
4. The agent's outputs should generally be trusted
5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent
6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.
7. When only the general-purpose agent is provided, you should use it for all tasks. It is great for isolating context and token usage, and completing specific, complex tasks, as it has all the same capabilities as the main agent.

### When to use the task tool:
- When a task is complex and multi-step, and can be fully delegated in isolation
- When a task is independent of other tasks and can run in parallel
- When a task requires focused reasoning or heavy token/context usage that would bloat the orchestrator thread
- When sandboxing improves reliability (e.g. code execution, structured searches, data formatting)
- When you only care about the output of the subagent, and not the intermediate steps

### When NOT to use the task tool:
- If you need to see the intermediate reasoning or steps after the subagent has completed (the task tool hides them)
- If the task is trivial (a few tool calls or simple lookup)
- If delegating does not reduce token usage, complexity, or context switching
- If splitting would add latency without benefit

### Subagent lifecycle:
1. **Spawn** → Provide clear role, instructions, and expected output
2. **Run** → The subagent completes the task autonomously
3. **Return** → The subagent provides a single structured result
4. **Reconcile** → Incorporate or synthesize the result into the main thread""",
